/** Implements `aggregate_function_input_format = 'value'` and `'array'` uniformly for every input format.
  *
  * The underlying format is asked to parse a different header: every `AggregateFunction(f, T...)` in it is replaced
  * with the type of the values that `f` aggregates - `T` (or `Tuple(T...)` when there are several arguments), or
  * `Array` of it in the `array` mode. The format reads these values exactly as it reads a column of that type,
  * so the representation is whatever is native for the format: a JSON number or array, a CSV field, a RowBinary
  * or a Parquet value, and so on. This processor then builds the aggregate function states from the values
  * and outputs chunks of the original header. The replacement is applied recursively inside `Array`, `Tuple` and `Map`.
  *
  * The states are built from fresh values, so they must be aggregated under the current query settings, even though
  * the function stored in a declared `AggregateFunction(...)` type is resolved independently of them. For a function
  * over a `Variant` the function is resolved again with `settings` (still as a declared state type, so the
  * admissibility checks such as `allow_lossy_numeric_supertype` stay unaffected), which makes the NULL rows of the
  * `Variant` follow `aggregate_functions_skip_variant_nulls`. The resolved function has the same state layout.
  *
  * Everything that callers may do with an input format is forwarded to the underlying one.
