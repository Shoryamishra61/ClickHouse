# The table function target of a `Remote` table is resolved only when the local shard is read, so the
# table attaches even while a collection its target references is missing (after a drop with
# `check_named_collection_dependencies = 0`). The collection must be held as soon as it is created
# again: whether it references a collection is decided from the stored definition, not from whether a
# collection with that name exists when the table is attached.
