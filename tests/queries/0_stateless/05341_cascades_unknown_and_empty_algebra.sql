-- Every operator of the Cascades derivation decides for itself what an unknown or a proven-empty
-- input means: a `UNION ALL` with an unknown input is unknown whatever its other inputs, an inner
-- join with a proven-empty side is empty even when the other side is unknown, a semi join over an
-- empty side is empty, a keyless aggregation of an unknown input is its one row while a keyed one
-- is unknown, and an any join emits each left row once. The cost token is stripped from the plan
-- lines: this test is about rows, and every change of a cost constant would move it otherwise.
