-- A condition moved to PREWHERE stays in the filter above the read as an input column. The

-- on top of the PREWHERE estimate, so the same conjunction estimated fewer rows when part of it

-- The assertion compares the two estimates with each other, so it holds whatever the default
-- factors and the sketch precision are, and requires them to be positive so that a failed
-- extraction cannot satisfy it.
