-- The rule-based distributed planner moves a join, an aggregation or a read into a new node under
-- a gather exchange. The row estimate stamped on the node has to move with the step, and the
-- gather carries it too, or `EXPLAIN estimates` and the profile log lose it for exactly the
-- rewritten steps. A global aggregation is estimated as well. An aggregation whose group count the
-- statistics do not give stays unknown: the input rows the strategy decision falls back to are not
-- reported as groups.
