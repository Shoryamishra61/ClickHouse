-- The builder of the plan with parallel replicas checks what it can before building anything. When it
-- stops there, the query is counted as skipped - by its settings or by its shape - not as a plan that

-- (`AutoParallelReplicasPlanNotSuitable`), and its time is not charged as building one
-- (`AutoParallelReplicasPlanBuildMicroseconds`).
