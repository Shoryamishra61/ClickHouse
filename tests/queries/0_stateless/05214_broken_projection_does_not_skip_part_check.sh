# be skipped whenever one of its projections was broken, which took the part's crash-corruption
# protection away with it: a marks file left empty by a power loss loads as an empty `index_granularity`,
# the row count becomes zero, and the acknowledged rows disappear from every query with nothing detached
# to recover them from. The part is detached as broken now, while a broken projection alone still is not.
