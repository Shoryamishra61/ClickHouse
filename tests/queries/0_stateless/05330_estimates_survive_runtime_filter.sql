-- A runtime filter is added above a join input after the join order is chosen. It wrapped the
-- input in a new plan node without the input's row estimate, and merging that filter with the
-- input's expression kept the new node, so `EXPLAIN estimates = 1` showed the input as unknown
-- whenever runtime filters were on. The filter node now carries the estimate of the input it wraps
-- (a runtime filter does not change the logical row count), and an expression merged into another
-- keeps the estimate of the one that had it.
