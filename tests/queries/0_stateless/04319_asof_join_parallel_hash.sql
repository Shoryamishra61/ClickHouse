-- An ASOF JOIN must return the same rows when one thread builds it and when four threads do. Each join
-- runs once serially, with `max_threads = 1`, and once in parallel, and stores its rows. The two results
-- are compared row by row with EXCEPT in both directions. Comparing count() and sum() would not work: the
-- two builds return rows in different orders, and that changes sum() over floats.
-- The join order optimization gives an ASOF join no estimate of the right table size, so the join always
-- builds the parallel layout. On one thread it has one slot, and no rows are split between slots. The join
-- reads `max_threads` from the whole query and not from a subquery, so each build runs in its own query.
