# Regression test for the merge memory reservation (CompactionStatistics::estimateNeededMemoryForMerge) on
# the marks side of the writer streams. Every MergeTreeWriterStream eagerly creates TWO buffer chains: the
# data chain (plain_file / compressor, sized by max_compress_block_size) and the marks chain
# (marks_file / marks_compressor, sized by marks_compress_block_size), and on object storage the marks file
# has its own multipart upload state as well. An estimate that models only the data half is short by the
# whole marks side for every wide stream and is not an upper bound on the buffers the merge allocates.
#
# The check is an invariant: the same table and data must reserve strictly more with a larger
# marks_compress_block_size, because the marks compressor block of every stream grows with it. Without the
# marks side the setting has no effect on the estimate at all.
#
# The reservation itself is the observable: a background merge is held on the
# plain_merge_task_pause_before_prepare failpoint right after StorageMergeTree::selectPartsToMerge has
# reserved its estimate, and the reserved amount is read from the MergesMutationsMemoryReservation metric
# while it waits. Each measurement runs in its own clickhouse-local process against its own data directory,
# so the process-wide metric only ever reflects that one merge.

# Prints the largest reservation observed while the selected merge is parked on the failpoint.
#
# The data is written by one clickhouse-local process and merged by the next one: a background merge is
# only selected once the parts are older than min_age_to_force_merge_seconds, which leaves the second
# process time to arm the failpoint before the merge is selected.
