-- The shared relation estimator takes the optimized join inside a subquery as the estimate of that
-- subquery, adds up the inputs of `UNION ALL` (the rows, and a column's distinct values as a bound:
-- 100 and 100 values give at most 200, so the join on the union key estimates 11000 rows / 200
-- values per key) and counts the distinct values of a `DISTINCT`. Without this a subquery with a
-- join, a union or a distinct is a relation without an estimate in the query around it. The hints
-- stand in for column statistics.
