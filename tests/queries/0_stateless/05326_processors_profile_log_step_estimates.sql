-- The join order optimizer stamps the row estimate of every relation and every join it decides
-- on the plan node; `EXPLAIN estimates = 1` prints it with the origin of the estimate, and every
-- processor records the estimate of the plan step that created it, so
-- `system.processors_profile_log` can compare it with the rows the step produced. A step's output
-- is the sum of `output_rows` over its processors whose consumers belong to other steps;
-- `parent_ids` lists the consumers of a processor. The hints stand in for column statistics so the
-- numbers are fixed.
